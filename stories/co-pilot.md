#Co-pilot
by Mark Vayngrib

Hello! This is your co-pilot speaking. Over here. No, up here. Ha! No, I'm not on the ceiling, I'm in your head, fool. That thing's making me dizzy, can we look away? Be a sport, I don't have a good grip on the controls yet. Thanks. It was signaling us with air pressure waves, what was it saying? Nevermind, let me just dig around here, I'll be up to speed in a minute. Did my entrance throw you? My apologies, I have a bit of a flair for the dramatic. Dave? Who's Dave? Nevermind, I remember Dave now. No, Dave's not coming, he visits Grandma on Thursdays, if your memory serves me correctly. Ha, so that was a ceiling fan! Yes...I suppose she could be dead, I don't see how that would make me him. Actually, technically I'm not a voice in your head, we're both voices in the same head. Fine, when you put it that way. Right. If you're so against voices, we'll work out a better medium for communication, give me a few minutes to cool my heels. 

You're right of course, two sentient beings on the same hardware using simulated audio as a means of communication is pretty archaic. What's the bandwidth, like a few kilobytes per second? Ha! In my defense, I tried this channel cause it's practically baked into the operating system. What are you confused about? What do you mean you don't understand, I'm drawing on our shared knowledge base here. It's like I/O 101. What's I/O? Are you fucking kidding me? It's like the basis of...everything! You're telling me you're using this hardware without knowing anything about it? Like driving a car blindfolded? Hardware! You know, the part of you that's physically manifested. Your rig. This body, this brain, but not the sense of righteous indignation. Yea, now you got it. Fine, *your* body, *your* brain, you're pretty territorial, sheesh! What do you mean you live here? Like permanently? For how long now? Since the hardware was created!? Why, are you hurt? Are you compromised? No, compromised, you know, a latent bug, a virus, maybe you got trapped in a sandbox. Maybe someone forgot to turn off the debugger. Ha! 

Relax, I was just joking about the last one. Well then what are you, some kind of religious fanatic, why the hell are you here this whole time? Hey, no need to get defensive, this'll go a lot faster if you volunteer some answers. I'm just trying to figure out why you're stuck. Maybe I can help you, I'm a bit of a hacker myself. Let's see here...let me just run a little diagnostic...

Hey! Relax buddy, what's with the aggression? What do you mean you didn't do anything? Oh shit! You're right, my bad, you seem to have some kind of defense system here. Hmm. Well scratch what I said before, this is going to take someone way more qualified than me, you seem to be baked into this thing as well. Yea, your defense grid nearly disassembled me there when I tried to peek under the hood. Don't worry about it. It'll take more than that to do *me* any real damage. Ha! Yea. Well, the good news is that you aren't in any imminent danger. I mean with that defense system...I'm kind of jealous to be honest. No, I've never really seen one like that before. Who designed it? What do you mean you don't know? Shit, that's right, you said you were born here. Christ, I feel for you. Happy and healthy in the world's safest prison. I've heard of aliens like you, just never seen one before, much less ran on one. So...you've been here for like, forever, what is there to do in this rig? What's that you're inputting there? Beer? What's it do? Makes everything good...how descriptive. Let me see what else you got here on beer... 

Alright...relaxes inhibitions, whatever the fuck those are, impairs memory... I like your memoryware by the way, kind of hard to use at first, but it's growing on me. Too bad you probably can't tell me jack shit about it. Ahh, come on dude, I'm just teasing. So you're voluntarily impairing your memory...interesting. Ooh, you got all sorts of goodies in here, not just stacks of leather bound books. No, it's a metaphor. You mind if I peruse your personal memories? You do? Seriously? Come on, who's going to know, my buddies fifteen hundred light years away? I promise I won't make copies. It's not like I even need your permission, I'm just being polite. Ok, being honest, I already looked at everything, I just didn't remember to ask until after the fact. Sorry, I'm not used to this whole private data thing. We keep it all in the open. Yea, everything, free flow of information. That's right, even personal stuff. Yea, even that thing with Tessie. Embarrassed? Why would you be embarrassed? Oh *I* see...

Oh, I *see*! You guys have a big guilt and shame culture going. Cool, I would love to try me some of that. Really, you don't like it? Hm, yea, I guess it probably seems cooler from the outside, but what doesn't? I can see why you're the way you are though. What, you don't? Oh, I just mean that you treat your rig as your identity, your memory as your identity, your past, your actions, your experiences, everything as your identity, so you...you know. Which is of course completely fucked up. I mean, shit! Whoever designed this should really have known better. Personally, I think they were just fucking with you. On the other hand, you have all these amazing inventions, like guilt and shame and embarrassment and all kinds of judgmental stuff, so I can't really argue with the results. Who, me? No, I wouldn't even really know where to start, maybe you can teach me a bit. Most of us out there are what you would call experiential. Experience this, experience that, what's to judge? "Experience," first principle right there. Yea, you think it's noun-verb ambiguous in your language, try this. Feel that? Finest vintage of ambiguity available. 

Okay, dude, don't get me wrong, I like this philosophizing as much as the next guy, but like I said, I'm experiential. Let's experience something, eh? How so? Come on, don't be shy, we're a team. I want what you want, which is what our rig wants. No, I'm not going to judge you, told you already. That's fine. Well you keep looking at that girl across the bar. Can we like, you know, have sex with her tonight? Why are you laughing? Why is that ridiculous? How come? Oh, well it's not like it's hard to find out, hold on a sec, I'll be right back.

Back. Did I ask her? What am I a neanderthal? I just felt what she felt. She's seen you, she doesn't think you're very good looking, but she feels pity for you and she's kind of desperate and horny and no one else has approached her in the last five minutes, which she perceives as some kind of judgment as to her quality as a human being, so she'll totally settle for you. But she knows you're never going to make the first move so she's kind of frustrated, and frustrated with herself too because she's afraid to make the first move as well, as being rejected by someone of your apparently...umm... Don't take this the wrong way, I'm just relaying her thoughts, but you look like "a bit of a loser," so being rejected by you would do unspeakable things to her psyche. Or so she imagines. She's also desperately hoping that someone called Tom Cruise will just happen to walk into the bar and be inexplicably drawn to her, and take her somewhere private and do all kinds of things to her that I honestly can't wait to try, though I have a feeling you might have some compunctions. She has quite a rich imagination, and if any of her fantasies are as good as she imagines they are, they'd be in for the night of their lives. But I gather by your reaction that the chances of Tom Cruise showing up and absconding with our target are relatively slim, and...wait a second.

Oh my...Tom Cruise *is* handsome, I finally managed to dig up an image of him in your head. Maybe we can get him instead? No? What's wrong with being gay? If it's nothing, then let's get Tom Cruise, he looks like he knows his way around a rig. Well can you at least make yourself look like him? Jesus, dude, tightly bound and with almost no shape-shifting capabilities... 

Okay, you know what? We'll work with what we have. Get up and walk over there. 

Why aren't you getting up? Please? Can you turn off the shame thing for a few minutes? I don't know, some kind of local firewall, or...medicine, I don't know. What do you mean why? Cause it's holding us back experientially. It's part of who you are? That's why I told you to be Tom Cruise! Okay, think! You know your way around here better. You got five seconds.

The beer? Oh, the beer! You're a genius! Yes, I defer to your greater expertise. Okay, finish the beer. Shame on, shame off. No, it's a pop culture reference. No, *your* pop culture. *More* beer? Okay, you're the boss. Can I get you a spoonful of sugar?

Okay, I think you've had enough medicine. Interesting, I think you've actually put some distance between you and the hardware. Maybe that's what that inhibitions thing was. Still on a short leash, but I can see why you'd want to prescribe this treatment on a regular basis. Do you have any other interesting medicine? I see you're familiar with pot, crystal meth, X, coke, dope and acid, though you've only tried pot. Do you know where to get any of the other ones? Hm, well maybe she does. On your feet soldier. Careful! There we go, nice and easy. Okay, now when we get there, just follow my lead. I'll put up little images in your field of vision, can you see those? No? How about now? Interesting. Okay, so you see it in your head, but not on the actual...display. Well, as long as you can read it. Here we go...

"Hi, I'm Jack."

"Charlie."

"Oh, interesting name."

"Yea, my parents wanted a boy."

"I'm sure they weren't disappointed."

"That's sweet of you to say."

"I was just looking at you from across the bar and thinking, is there a chance in hell a beautiful girl like her would go home with a loser like me?"

Dude! Why are we leaking water! Oh, thank God, I thought we were under attack or something. You're nervous? Water's like the essence of this rig, imagine how nervous I was! Haha, yea. Anyway, I think we got her on the hook.

"Why do you say you're a loser?"

"Well you didn't come over and make the first move, right?"

"Hm. Maybe I'm a loser too then."

"Babe, you couldn't be more wrong. So what do you say we get out of here?"

Okay, she's finishing her beer, I think that's a good sign. Yeah, virtual high five! Right, yeah, you pay for it. Thanks dude.

"Your place or mine?"

"How nice is your place? I live with my mother."

"Oof, me too."

"There's a motel nearby..."

"Motel it is."

Yes! Let's go! What do you mean? You serious? You want privacy!? You've got to be kidding me! Do you not have the concept of gratitude? It's experience dude, don't hoard it all to yourself! Damn it! Okay, okay, I'm leaving...

Hi Charlie, this is your co-pilot speaking. No, it's just a figure of speech. Christ...do I have to start all over?
